## Description

- My motivation was to create an terminal application that a user could manage an employe database and organize it by department, role, salary, etc.
- I built this project to learn mysql and expand my knowledge in javasript and node.js and how to more efficiently use command-line features.
- It allows user to create a database with as many departments, roles, and employees. It also allow user to update an employee from a worker to a manager.
- Learned how to write schema.sql and seeds.sql and db.query to manipulate database files.

## Installation

- Clone code from GitHub repository:
- Open in VS Code and command-line terminal.
- Start mysql and SOURCE scheema.sql and seeds.sql.
- Exit mysql an type 'node index.js' to start application. 

## Usage
  
 - After typing 'node index.js' in command-line terminal, the menu prompt will appear where user can select from choices to premorm various tasks.
